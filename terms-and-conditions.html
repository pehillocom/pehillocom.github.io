            <h4>1. PURPOSE OF THE STAY</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              One or multiple vacation rentals are available on the Pehillo property, located
              at 1388 Route de Pehillo, 47600 Nérac in France for leisure or
              professional stays but may not be used as primary or secondary residence, nor
              for any commerciale activity of any sort.
            </p>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Two of the vacation rentals can accommodate up to 6 people (Gîte de
              la Source et Gîte du Pigeonnier), and one of the rentals up to 4 people (Gîte de
              la Sapinière). Should the number of guests exceed the above numbers without prior
              agreement, the property managers reserves the right to either charge an additional
              fee for each additional guest, deny access for all additional guests, or cancel the
              reservation without any refunds depending on the situation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-10 mr-5 mb-5">
            <h4>2. VACATION RENTALS AND PROPERTY</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Each rental includes the entirety of the first and second floor described on the
              reservation confirmation document. The 17-hectare Pehillo property is not fenced
              and is to be shared with all other guests on the property. The parking lot is
              available for all guests. Guests may not access locations marked with "Propriété
              Privée" or "Interdit" without prior authorization.
            </p>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              During your stay, the property manager may stop by in case of maintenance of the common
              areas and pool, but will only do so with prior communication and with a reasonable timeline,
              unless there is an emergency.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-10 mr-5 mb-5">
            <h4>3. CHECK-IN / CHECK-OUT</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Check-in is after 5 PM, check-out is before 10 AM.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-10 mr-5 mb-5">
            <h4>4. SERVICE AND PRICING</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Upon arrival of the guests, each rental will be clean, beds will be made and towels
              will be ready for use. Rooms will be disinfected and the house will be aerated.
              Each rental is made available to tenants for independent management. Each occupant
              will also have a set of towels upon arrival (not renewed during the stay). Final exit
              cleaning is included with standard booking. The prices are indicated in Euros in the
              booking confirmation. VAT is not included (article 293b of the CGI).
            </p>
          </div>

            <h4>5. ANIMALS</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Animals are not permitted on the property.

            <h4>6. THE POOL</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              The pool is not monitored by a lifeguard but is protected with a fence and an alarm.
              The pool is to be used exclusively by adult guests. Guests accompanied by minors can
              use the pool at their own risk. The pool is a shared space with all other occupants
              of the property. The pool rules are printed on premises and must be respected. Failure
              to cooperate with these rules will result in guests being blocked from using the pool
              for the remainder of their stay. Please respect other guests.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-10 mr-5 mb-5">
            <h4>7. REQUIREMENTS UPON CHECK OUT OF PREMISES</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Though the final cleaning at the end of your stay is included in the cost of your stay,
              the interior and exterior of the rental must be returned in the same way that they were
              found. The kitchen must be clean (dishwasher emptied), sheets stripped off the bed,
              barbecue cleaned and all garbage taken out. All fees for damaged or broken items and
              additional cleaning necessary will be removed from the deposit.

          </div>

            <h4>8. USE OF PREMISES</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Guests must respect the peacefulness of the property. The use of the property cannot
              benefit even partially to third parties, natural or legal persons. Occupants/tenants
              may under no circumstances claim any right to remain in the premises at the end of
              the period of stay, as stated in the booking confirmation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-10 mr-5 mb-5">
            <h4>9. RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              Les Gîtes de Pehillo declines all responsibility in the event of loss, theft or
              damage to personal property within its structure. The tenant is solely responsible
              for damage caused within the structure and its surroundings during his stay. All
              equipment belonging to the gîtes de Pehillo and made available to the client must
              be returned in good condition at the end of the stay. Otherwise, the guests must
              return their equipment at their own expense or the establishment may charge them
              for the repair or replacement.

            <h4>10. ELECTRIC VEHICLE</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">
              It is strictly forbidden to charge electric vehicles with any socket on the Pehillo
              property without the prior agreement of the owner or the property manager. It could result
              in an electrical outage, overheating or even start of fire. Any repairs resulting from wild
              EV charging or any additional electricity consumption costs observed are borne
              entirely by the occupants/tenants and may, where applicable, be deducted from the deposit.
